                <h1>TYPING BLOCKS</h1>
                <p class="shortWord1">Typing is a very useful technique that is used in practically every industry.
                    Accurate and<br>  quick typing is a life skill that will benefit people in many aspects.
                    Typing accuracy is<br>  important because it helps to lessen errors in data. 
                    In the meantime, speed also helps<br>  in managing time in situations like deadlines or finishing other tasks in less time.
                    Typing<br>  is  a frequent activity for many people and needs to be developed for beginners.
                    Typing Blocks is a desktop based game program that needs to be downloaded through a<br>   website to play offline.
                    Students can freely join this game to practice their typing skills.<br>  Its benefits are to improve speed, accuracy, vocabulary, and focus.
                    However, this game can only be played on a computer.
                    To play the game, players had to type the words or symbols written inside the blocks.

                <p class="mySelf">Greetings!, it's Joash Dato-on. While I have limited experience in game development,<br> my main specific expertise is creating websites. 
                    Despite having originally intended to<br> focus on web design, I have been assigned the duty of developing a game for our<br> capstone project.
                    I've spent a lot of time and energy creating and improving<br> websites, which is the main focus of my passion and enjoyment.<br><br>
                    I began developing websites using basic languages like HTML and CSS, which<br> taught me how to organize and style online content. I've also experimented 
                    with<br> JavaScript, learning enough to improve the functionality and interaction of websites.<br> Although I don't have much experience with JavaScript yet, I'm eager to learn more<br> 
                    about it. I once took an introductory course in C#, which helped me learn more<br> about programming ideas outside of web development.<br><br>
                    I am interested in learning more about Python in the future because of its adaptability<br> and rising demand in a variety of industries, including web development and beyond.<br> My objective 
                    is to use the programming languages I'm learning more about to start a<br> front-end web developer freelance career. With this project, I hope to help create<br> aesthetically pleasing and simple
                    websites while offering clients in need of<br> functionality and a digital presence useful services.<br><br>
                    I'm excited to learn new things and grow my career as a developer. I<br> appreciate you coming along on this thrilling journey with me. Together,<br> let's keep exploring and developing in the field of technology.
